---

### 6. Institutions

Institutions are extensively reworked: their bonuses, historical spread and regional catch-up rules differ from vanilla.

##### Institution bonuses
- **Feudalism:** +1 free leader pool.
- **Renaissance:** -5% development cost and -5% construction cost.

---

### 7. Colonization and overseas empires

##### Colonial regions
The mod defines **20 colonial regions**, including Canada, Louisiana, California, Mexico, Caribbean, Colombia, Peru, La Plata, Brazil, Australia, Columbia, Hudson Bay, New Amsterdam, Georgia, Honduras, Texas, Congo, New Zealand, South Africa and the Philippines.

##### Trade companies
There are **61 trade-company regions**, including trade-company zones across Europe as well as Africa and Asia.

This includes nodes such as English Channel, North Sea, L�beck, Baltic Sea, Sevilla, Genoa, Venice, Constantinople, Novgorod, Kiev, Persia, India, China, Japan and Polynesia.

##### Trade-company investments
Trade-company investments are rebalanced into stronger military, production, development, manpower and naval paths.

Examples:
- Defensive quarters increase local defensiveness and supply.
- Warehouses/depot investments increase production efficiency and trade power.
- Broker investments increase goods produced.
- Settlements/districts reduce development cost.
- Military administration can double local manpower and sailors.
- Unique 1000-ducat investments can grant force limit, trade steering, manpower/sailors or other country-wide benefits.

##### Colonial range
Patch 3.24 redistributes early colonial range:
- DIP 3 no longer gives the old +100 colonial range.
- DIP 5 gives +30 range.
- DIP 6 gives +70 range.
- DIP 7 continues the expansion with +115 range.

---

### 8. Subjects and liberty desire

Subject scaling is rebalanced.

- Standard vassal-style subjects use **0.15 liberty desire per development** instead of 0.25.
- Client vassals and client marches use only **0.05**.
- Colonial subjects use **0.15** instead of 0.10.
- Colonial subjects are prevented from gaining normal government rank.

Eyalets are also altered:
- Eyalet development contributes only 0.1 liberty desire per development.
- Eyalets transfer trade, pay a larger share of income and contribute force limit/manpower/sailors.
- Core Eyalets provide still larger contributions and can be integrated at a custom development cost.

---

### 9. Buildings and force-limit scaling

Patch 3.24 replaces the old province-triggered force-limit system with scripted scaling tied directly to province development.

##### Regimental Camp
- Base: +0.125 land force limit.
- Additional force limit scales upward every 5 development.
- Scaling reaches +3.75 at 75+ development.

##### Conscription Center
- Base: +0.25 land force limit.
- Additional scaling is roughly double the Regimental Camp.
- Scaling reaches +7.5 at 75+ development.

The correct modifier is recalculated when the building is constructed/upgraded, province development changes, development is exploited, development is concentrated, and during periodic five-year maintenance checks.

---

### 10. Espionage and diplomatic actions

##### Support Heir
Monarchies can use a large spy network and money to support a foreign heir/dynasty candidate, with costs scaling by target rank and a long cooldown.

##### Force Tributary CB
The Emperor of China can spend spy network to obtain a temporary Force Tributary CB:
- normally 80 spy network,
- reduced to 40 with completed Spy Ideas.

---

### 11. Netherlands and the VOC

The Netherlands can create a true VOC subject.

When established:
- Dutch-owned provinces in India and the East Indies are transferred to the VOC.
- VOC becomes a **Commercial Enterprise** subject.
- It receives a trade-company government, the overlord's religion/culture/technology group, large starting monarch power and treasury, and permanent claims across India and the East Indies.
- A later decision transfers further Dutch conquests to the VOC.

---

### 12. Multiplayer stalemate system

The mod contains a custom multiplayer anti-stalemate system.

- Up to three wars can be tracked simultaneously.
- Once activated, a war receives a **36-month stalemate timer**.
- A qualifying siege victory resets the timer to 36 months.
- The system cleans itself up when the tracked war ends.
- Dedicated decisions/events are used to declare and enforce stalemate handling.

---

### 13. Estates

Patch 3.24 adds a set of early-game estate advisor privileges.

New advisor privileges exist for:
- Nobility
- Burghers
- Clergy
- Rajputs
- Marathas
- Brahmins
- Vaishyas
- Ghulams

They generally trade:
- **-15% advisor cost** in the estate's monarch-power category,
- estate loyalty/influence,
- higher stability cost,
- and reduced maximum absolutism.

Most are restricted to smaller countries, giving sub-100-development states an additional early-game estate choice.

---

### 14. Advisors and ruler personalities

- **79 additional advisor types** are defined.
- **69 additional ruler personalities** are defined.

These include court, religious, administrative, trade, colonial, naval, military and estate-specific roles and traits.

---

### 15. Government reforms and mechanics

The government system is substantially expanded beyond vanilla.

The branch includes custom mechanics for, among others:
- Imperial Grace
- Imperial Control
- Bureaucracy vs. Military
- Catholics vs. Utraquists
- Crusade Power
- Italian Condottieri
- Italian Dynasties
- Legitimation through Representation
- Liberalism
- Maritime Republics
- Political Focus
- Republican vs. Monarchist politics
- Rajput principalities
- Sicilian government
- Venetian government
- Pratihara mechanics

There are also many additional country- and region-specific reforms for Europe, India, Persia, Africa and East Asia.

---

### 16. Monuments

Three major custom monuments are added.

##### Fortress of Luxembourg
A very powerful defensive monument with fort levels, garrison size, defender dice, defensiveness and hostile attrition.

##### Rock of Gibraltar
Focused on controlling Gibraltar with fort levels, supply, hostile fleet attrition, very high defensiveness and defender dice at tier 3.

##### Hohenzollern Castle
Provides prestige and defensive bonuses, with much stronger conditional military bonuses when owned by the **von Hohenzollern** dynasty.

---

### 17. Events, disasters and historical content

The mod bundles a large amount of extra historical/flavour content beyond vanilla.

Notable additional or expanded disaster/event systems include:
- Decline of the Ottomans
- Mughal crisis/decline
- Bahmani decline
- Vijayanagar decline
- Partition of Poland
- Portuguese Succession Crisis
- Rampjaar
- Pashtun Uprising
- Zemene Mesafint
- Habsburg-monarchy division
- Italian republican crises
- Vijayabahu Kollaya
- Fall of Cromwell
- Chmielnicki uprising

There are also large country-event packages for Austria, France, Britain, Iberia, Russia, Persia, India, the Netherlands, Italy, the HRE and many smaller countries.

---

### 18. Country, map and historical setup changes

The Live branch contains extensive country-history, province-history, diplomacy and tag changes.

These include:
- altered 1444 country/province setups,
- additional formable or alternate states,
- custom country names and colours,
- expanded colonial naming,
- modified HRE history/diplomacy,
- changes across Oceania and other underrepresented regions,
- and many country-specific historical adjustments.

The mod therefore should not be treated as vanilla's 1444 map with only balance changes; its historical setup is materially different.

---

### 19. Patch 3.24 release highlights

While the rest of this document is cumulative versus vanilla, the **3.24 release itself** is especially centered on:

- Development-scaled force-limit buildings.
- Replacement of the old triggered-modifier force-limit system.
- New estate advisor privileges.
- Reworked Humanist government-reform requirements/effects.
- Redistribution of early colonial range across DIP technology.
- Further colonial-region and trade-company restructuring.
- New/reworked trade-company investments.
- Stalemate-system revisions.
- Several map/history cleanup changes.

## v3.24.2 <small>[↑ Back to top](#changelogs)</small>

**Compared against:** 3.24  
**3.24 commit:** `5e2908ce277c047279b62a3144e979dc86d18de0`  
**3.24.2 commit:** `d10ad43416aa49935f9d5199310bf914bed74df2`

This changelog compares the actual repository snapshots of 3.24 and 3.24.2, so intermediate unnumbered commits and 3.24.1 are only represented where their changes still exist in 3.24.2.

#### Age modifier system

- Reworked the large age-based triggered-modifier system.
- **88 triggered modifiers** were moved out of `common/triggered_modifiers/` and rebuilt as normal country modifiers controlled through scripted effects and on-actions.
- The new system refreshes applicable age bonuses during a yearly pulse and refreshes/cleans them when a new age begins.
- This covers:
  - **30** Age of Discovery modifiers
  - **21** Age of Reformation modifiers
  - **15** Age of Absolutism modifiers
  - **5** industrial/imperial-era modifiers handled by the age script
  - **17** Age of Revolutions modifiers
- The underlying bonuses are largely carried over; the main change is how and when the game evaluates/applies them.
- Because they are no longer continuously evaluated as triggered modifiers, gaining or losing the conditions for one of these bonuses is now handled through the refresh pulse rather than instant continuous recalculation.

Examples of migrated bonuses include development milestones, country-specific age bonuses, merchant-region bonuses, religious-unity and culture-unification bonuses, and colonial/trade/military/industrial/government-condition bonuses.

#### Colonial range

The early colonial-range redistribution introduced in 3.24 has been reverted.

- **Diplomatic Technology 3** once again grants **+100 colonial range**.
- The extra **+30 colonial range at Diplomatic Technology 5** has been removed.
- The extra **+70 colonial range at Diplomatic Technology 6** has been removed.
- Diplomatic Technology 7 retains its existing **+115 colonial range**.

- **88** old triggered-modifier files removed as part of the age-modifier migration.
- `common/event_modifiers/aet_modifiers.txt` expanded with the replacement modifiers.
- `common/scripted_effects/aet_scripted_effects.txt` expanded with the new age refresh/apply logic.
- `common/on_actions/aet_on_actions.txt` updated to refresh those modifiers yearly and on age changes.

## v3.24.3 <small>[↑ Back to top](#changelogs)</small>

**Compared against:** 3.24.2  
**3.24.2 commit:** `d10ad43416aa49935f9d5199310bf914bed74df2`  
**3.24.3 commit:** `942912ebe5b050787b96f76ad9af962580cacbcd`

This changelog compares the exact numbered release snapshots of **3.24.2** and **3.24.3**.

#### Core Eyalets

- Fixed **Core Eyalets** so they can now be diplomatically annexed.
- This restores the annexation option that was previously missing for Ottoman Core Eyalet subjects.
- Cleaned up the Eyalet subject-type definitions to avoid redundant empty declarations.

#### Elections
*Note to Reader: This entire Section is wrong but the original version was preserved*
- Fixed ruler generation in one of the republican election paths.
- Election-generated rulers now receive explicit base stats instead of relying on stat-change commands without a defined starting value.
- The **Republican Virtues** path now starts the new ruler at **2/2/2** before applying its +1 ADM / +1 DIP / +1 MIL bonuses.
- The alternate female-ruler branch now creates a **2/2/2** ruler directly.

#### Colonial regions

- Corrected the **Caribbean colonial region** by removing province **481** (Bermuda) from its province list.

## v3.25.1 <small>[↑ Back to top](#changelogs)</small>

**Compared against:** 3.24.3  
**3.24.3 commit:** `942912ebe5b050787b96f76ad9af962580cacbcd`  
**3.25.1 commit:** `6943039d6549c7bc306e85342f6ca3ebe437e1c6`

This changelog compares the exact numbered release snapshots of **3.24.3** and **3.25.1**.

#### Holy Roman Empire overhaul removed

The integrated **Besseres HRR / Holy Roman Empire Expanded** content has been removed from the mod.

#### Dutch elections

The Dutch election event has been substantially rewritten.

- Statist candidates are now generated before the election choice is resolved.
- Candidate generation now uses randomized ADM/DIP/MIL stats rather than the fixed 2/2/2 setup used previously.
- Generated candidates receive +1 to each monarch skill after generation.
- Countries with **Republican Virtues** receive another +1 ADM, +1 DIP and +1 MIL.
- Each monarch skill also has an independent **6.25% chance** to gain another +1.
- The generated Statist candidate is stored and then installed when the Statist option is selected.
- Temporary ruler/heir handling was added so candidate generation can occur without permanently disrupting the country used as temporary scope.

> Note: This explanation is not entirely correct. However it comes close to correct. Monarch pips get randomised as common, clamped to [0, 4] and improved by 1. After that the other steps explained here get applied. This uses a system similar to lottery elections (the last two points).

#### Country renaming

A set of new country-renaming options has been added.

##### Netherlands
- Verenigde Provinci�n der Cara�ben
- Vrije Handelsstaat
- Groot Koopmansrijk
- Verenigde Koopmansstaten

- Republik delle Alpes
- Civitatum Raetiae et Noricum

#### On Actions

Modifying how Elite Guards work via decisions costs Action Points. Up to 5 Action Points can be stored. You regain one Action Point per year. Currently you have stored `[ROOT.aet_eliteGuards_actions_bank.GetValue]` Action Points.

If you take an action while you are below 0 stored Action Points, it will cost 20 × 2^n Military Power, where `n` is the number of actions you have taken while below 0 stored Action Points. This cost is capped at 600 Military Power.
